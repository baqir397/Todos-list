            <p>It's a list of tasks you need to complete, or things that you want to do. Most typically, they're organised in order of priority. 
                Traditionally, they're written on a piece of paper or post it notes and acts as a memory aid.</p>
            <p> A close second is that is this: a to-do list helps prevent your most urgent things from slipping through the cracksâ€”it prevents 
                you from dropping any major balls</p>
            <p>Have more than one list. If you are the kind of person that cannot remember things if they are not written down, then it is worth 
                having two (or more) lists: ...
                Keep your daily or weekly lists manageable. ...
                Keep your list up to date.</p>
